# PopulationEvolution

This project is a group project made during my first year at Ecole Centrale de Lyon.
It aims to predict the evolution of a population of nematode.

It consists of three parts : 
- An applied analysis part where the evolution is studied using differentials equations
- A numerical analysis part where the evolution is studied through a numerical simulation in matlab
- A statistical part where the evolution is studied using random variables.

The only part I did was the numerical analysis part 2.1, thus in the [`rendu_projet_maths.html`](rendu_projet_maths.html) file I only take credits for that part. This file explains the whole project (in french only unfortunately).
